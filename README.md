# SteamVR-Webkit [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BenWoodford/SteamVR-Webkit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BenWoodford/SteamVR-Webkit)

Toolkit for building WebKit-based overlays for SteamVR.

Honestly, I'm awful at writing documentation so part of me is hoping someone else will come along and write one. SteamVR-WebKit-Test should tell you a lot about what you need to use this though.
